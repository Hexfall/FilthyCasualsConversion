 Vestland_nation_desc:0 "The deposition of the Pope in Rome shook the Vestland world to it's core. In a move to distance themselves from the Empire and any undue influence from the no-longer infallible Pope, the house of d'Oriental moved to install a patriarch in Jerusalem to head the church of the Golden Path. The decision would splinter and fragment the Vestland Empire, as many of the nations peoples still clung to the Pope as a figurehead. The undeniable truth of the matter, however, is that fragmented or not, a Christian nation now resides in the Mashriq, and it's only a matter of time before it reunites again under one church or the other and begins to wield its might outwards again."

 gateway_of_christendom:0 "The Gateway of Christendom"
 gateway_of_christendom_desc:0 "Though the foundation of the Vestland state lay in the reclamation of the Holy Land, its expansion lay as much in the spread of Christendom as it does the pursuit of domination of the trade between Asia and the Christian world.
